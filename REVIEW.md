## Code Review
  
1 - The names of the variables you chose are usually good, try to get all of them right though.  
2 - There is a general lack of comments, really remember to add some!
3 - Your storyboard looks a bit cluttered, but not very bad.  
4 - The layout of your app looks reasonable, most things are neatly in place.  
5 - The formatting of your code is overall good and readable.  
6 - The name of your controllers and other files are understandable.  
7 - Your app contains much duplicate code, try to improve that.  
8 - You do pay attention to using constants and variables.  
9 - Typecasting is a bit of a mess at some places.  
10 - Code is divisioned into multiple lines when it is about to get messy. This allows for good reading.
